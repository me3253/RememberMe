A first-person, VR horror experience created in Unity using the aesthetics of an old Playstation 1 game! Sit through the horrifying nightmare of your deepest, darkest memories. Created for the Virtual Reality class at the University of Utah in Fall 2023.

All assets for the game were created by scratch with free textures found online. With the textures, we compressed them to match the original Playstation's low resolution size. A [free low poly model](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/low-poly-mesh-base-0f9579e2d298480aa26a0d9fed9307a9) was decimated for a lower polygon count then rigged in Blender to be posed in our classroom. Hope you enjoy!
